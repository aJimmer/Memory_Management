GENERAL USAGE NOTES
********************************************************************
-  The purpose of this program is to demonstrate memory management
   by writing a simulation that explores the effects of limited
   memory and memory management policies.  The simulator reads
   policy information and characteristics of the workload from input
   files.  It then simulates the execution of the processes as well
   as the decisions of the Memory Manager.  It then generates output
   with the trace of important events that occur during this time,
   as well as a memory map and the input queue status after each
   event.
   
   At the end of the simulation, the program prints the average
   turnaround time per process.`

-  This program will only run on UNIX/LINUX based operating
   systems.  It will not work on any version of Windows.

-  This program was written in C++.
